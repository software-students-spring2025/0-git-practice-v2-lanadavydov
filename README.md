## What I Found Interesting About the Article

I found Jackson Gabbard’s perspective on developer progression particularly insightful, especially his emphasis on the meritocratic nature of the tech industry. Unlike many other fields where career advancement is often tied to tenure or credentials, software engineering is more about demonstrated skill and impact. This resonates with me as I approach graduation, knowing that my ability to solve complex problems and contribute meaningfully to a team will matter more than how many years I’ve been coding.

Additionally, I appreciated his breakdown of the transition from junior to senior levels, particularly how the focus shifts from learning technical skills to making strategic decisions. The distinction between mid-level engineers optimizing solutions for the sake of elegance and senior engineers prioritizing pragmatism and impact is something I hadn’t fully considered before. It’s a reminder that technical excellence is just one piece of the puzzle, while developing judgment, mentorship, and a broader understanding of system trade-offs is equally crucial.
